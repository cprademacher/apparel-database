For this assignment my group and I were tasked with creating a real-world full-stack application to showcase to potential employers. We used both Node and Express back end had GET and POST routes for adding new data, our application is structured around the MVC paradigm and uses a Handlebars.js engine. Our application is an inventory management system for a clothing company where we are able to add, delete, and update new and existing inventory, the inventory is grouped together by seasonal categories for your convenience.
